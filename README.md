## Explanation
first, here is a small review of the subject:
im having a next js tailwind project
its a kinda blog for photographers where they can upload their photos
now the project is on development process so im using local storage for storing the uploaded pics for test
the task i wanna solve is that i want when a user clicked on a pic, it goes to a new page dedicated to that picture
the problem: since the photos will be uploaded by the users (dynamic) and they are not hard coded, i need a dynamic solution as well

one way to this is [id] thing in next js but as long as i know this is not really good with working with local storage

this is my problem now that i want a system to be able to click on pics (either the hard coded or the new uploaded ones in local storage) and [id] is not really solving it

use the links and give me an answer
one thing to say is: im ok to change the methods i have now (either using the local storage or [id ] thing) as long as its free and you can help me with the code
all share the related code later on
